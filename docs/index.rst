Understanding the Purchase Process
----------------------------------

Before we dive into the download process, it’s helpful to understand what happens when you purchase PC Matic.

When you buy PC Matic—typically from its official website—you create a user account using your email address. That email becomes your primary login for managing licenses, downloading the software, and accessing support.

After your purchase, you should receive a confirmation email containing:

- Your receipt
- Account login information or prompts to set up a password
- A direct download link or instructions to access your dashboard

If you purchased PC Matic from a third-party site, you might instead receive a license key that you will enter after downloading the software from the official source.

Where to Begin: Locate Your Account
-----------------------------------

To download PC Matic after purchase, your first stop should be your **PC Matic account**. Here's what you should do:

1. **Visit the Official Website**

   Open your preferred web browser and go to the PC Matic website. Look for the **Login** or **My Account** button—usually in the upper right-hand corner of the homepage.

2. **Log In Using Your Credentials**

   Use the email address and password you created at the time of purchase. If you haven’t set a password yet, look for an option like “Forgot password” or “Create password” and follow the instructions.

3. **Navigate to Your Dashboard**

   Once logged in, you'll land on your account dashboard. This is where you manage your licenses, devices, and downloads.

Finding Your Download Link
---------------------------

Inside the dashboard, look for a section labeled something like **“Downloads”**, **“My Products”**, or **“Install PC Matic.”** This is where your download link is located.

Steps to download:

- Click the download link for your operating system. PC Matic supports Windows and macOS.
- The installer file will begin downloading to your device.
- Save the file somewhere you can easily find it, like your **Downloads** folder or Desktop.

If you're using a new device or reinstalling, repeat these steps to access your account and re-download the installer. There’s no need to repurchase the software.

Installing After Downloading
----------------------------

Once the installer is downloaded, it’s time to install PC Matic on your device.

**For Windows Users:**

1. Open your ``Downloads`` folder and double-click on the PC Matic installer file (typically named ``pcmatic-setup.exe``).
2. Allow the application to make changes to your device when prompted.
3. Follow the installation prompts: accept the license agreement, log in with your PC Matic credentials, and complete the setup.
4. Once installed, the application will launch, and you’ll be able to run your first scan.

**For macOS Users:**

1. Double-click on the ``PC-Matic.pkg`` file in your Downloads folder.
2. Follow the on-screen installation steps.
3. You may be asked to enter your system password to authorize changes.
4. Grant Full Disk Access under ``System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy`` to enable full functionality.
5. Launch the application and sign in with your email and password.

Reinstalling on a New Device
----------------------------

If you're reinstalling PC Matic on a new device, no worries—your purchase allows installation on multiple devices (up to the limit of your subscription). The steps remain the same:

1. Log in to your PC Matic account on the new device.
2. Go to the **Downloads** section.
3. Download and install the appropriate version.
4. Log in during installation or first launch to activate your license.

There’s no need to enter a license key when using the account login method. Your credentials handle that automatically.

Troubleshooting Common Issues
-----------------------------

Downloading and installing PC Matic is usually smooth, but occasionally, users run into hiccups. Here’s how to handle the most common ones:

**Didn’t Receive Confirmation Email?**

- Check your Spam or Junk folder.
- If you still can’t find it, try logging into your account with the email you used during purchase. You can reset your password if needed.

**Can’t Log Into Your Account?**

- Double-check your email address.
- Use the “Forgot password” option to reset it.
- Make sure you’re using the correct login page from the official website.

**Download Link Not Working?**

- Try a different browser or disable any ad blockers that might be interfering.
- Ensure your internet connection is stable.
- If the problem persists, contact PC Matic support via your account dashboard.

**Installer Won’t Run?**

- On Windows, right-click the installer and choose **Run as Administrator**.
- On macOS, check your system settings to allow applications from identified developers.

Your PC Matic account also allows you to:

- View how many devices are using your license
